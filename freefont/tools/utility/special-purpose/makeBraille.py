Replaces the Braille Pattern range in a font.  There must already be
characters defined there.

Two auxiliar glyphs, in variables glyphOff and glyphOn below, represent the
off and on state of the Braille dots, respectively.

One also needs to set the font file path, the width between columns of dots,
and the width between rows of dots, as well as the width of the glyphs.

The first 64 Braille Patterns consist of two columns of four dots,
the bottom two of which are all zero.  The other 6 dots are represented
by the bit patterns of the octal digits of the offset from the range start.

The remaining three sets of 64 patterns repeat the first set, with 
the bottom two dots being the bit pattern for the numbers 1 to 4 in binary.

There are standards for the *punching* of patterns, e.g.
	National Library of Congress
	National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped
	Specification #800, 2008
	Braille Books and Pamphlets
	http://www.loc.gov/nls/specs/800_march5_2008.pdf
Among other things, it specifies:
	base dot diameter 0.057
	distance center-to-center in a cell 0.092
	distance center-to-center in adjacent cells 0.254
which ratios with a fixed width of 600EM should result in
	center-to-center in cell = 160EM
	center-to-center adjacent = 440EM
	diameter = 99EM
